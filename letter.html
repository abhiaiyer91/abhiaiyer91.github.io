<p class="lead"> This SHOULD be the easiest letter to write. Words SHOULD flow out like bullshit on a HUM paper. But I've hit a block. It SHOULD be simple for me tell you how amazing my life has been since I met you. Somehow I can't possibly say everything in this letter.</p>
<p class="lead"> I love you so much baby girl. I always dream about that amazing joy that will come as we grow more mature. Everytime I leave you for the week, I get anxious. I immediately look forward to the next day I get to see you.<p>
<p class="lead">As you know I love music. And I drop quotes all the time. So I figured I should keep this ruse up. You're the music in me baby. Here's our song!</p>
<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
	<h2> Sure Thing </h2>
<p>Love You Like a Brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover</p>
<p>

You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that [x4]
</p>
<p>
If you be the cash
I'll be the rubber band
You be the match
Imma be your fuse
Boom!
Painter baby you
Could be the muse
I'm the reporter baby
You could be the news
Cause you're the cigarette
And I'm the smoker
We raise a bet...
Cause you're the joker
Truth though
You are the chalk
And I could be the blackboard
And you can be the talk
And I could be the walk
</p>
<p>
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire baby
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
</p>
<p>
Cause this love is a sure thing
</p>

<p>
You could bet that
Never got to sweat that [x4]
</p>
<p>
You could be the lover
I'll be the fighter babe
If I'm the blunt
You could be the lighter babe
Fire it up!
Writer baby
You could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby
You could be the note
Record that!
Saint, I'm a sinner
Prize, I'm a winner
And it's you
What can I do to deserve that
Paper baby
I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one
Cause you are a ten
Real and not pretend!
</p>
<p>
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire baby
Even when it's do or die
We can do it babe simple and plain
Cause this love is a sure thing
</p>
<p>
Rock with me baby
Let me hold you in my arms
Talk with me baby
[X2]
</p>
<p>
This love
Between you and I
As simple as pie baby
Such a sure thing
Oh is it a sure thing [x2]
</p>
<p>
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire baby
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
This love is a sure thing
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
</p>
